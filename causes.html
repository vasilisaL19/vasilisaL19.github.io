    The main cause of food insecurity is poverty. 
  38.3 million Americans simply can’t afford food, or enough quality food. Living within a mile of a grocery store and having acess to reliable transportation for the route there and back does not help. Low wages and centuries of discrimination have led to a situation where many low-income households spend over a quarter of their income on food, whereas middle and high-income households spend more money, but still a smaller percentage of their income, on food.

      <strong> Lack of Access to Farming Lands
</p></strong>
     <p>
       
  Income is generated from the same land food is produced or grown. But many people are stripped of the opportunity to acquire wealth by their lack of ownership to land, along with  their lack of access to farmable land. Without access to suitable land, individuals can’t grow crops or raise livestock, reducing their food supply. They also can't generate income from their crops and livestock, forcing them into poverty. They end up with barely any income or food, and experience high levels of food insecurity as a result.

  3. Land Grabbing

    <p>
      Land grabbing is when influential government officials or large investors take away land traditionally owned or farmed by families, groups, and communities for the purpose of acquiring wealth and influence by growing food for export  or extracting natural resources. Land grabbing often includes large-scale acquisitions of fertile land, displacing and depriving local farmers and communities of the resources they desperately require to grow food crops and vegetables for survival. The ultimate outcome is poverty and social instability, which worsens food insecurity.

      Conflicts, wars, and violence impact food production and supplies in various negative ways. Armed conflicts directly disrupt food systems by damaging infrastructure, critical facilities, and making  trade routes  unsafe. Adding on, people and livestock are forced to flee conflict zones, affecting agricultural production.Food insecurity is very high in most countries where civil war has been prevalent because of the way conflict hinders food production and distribution. Various examples of conflict, war and violence leading to insanely high levels of food insecurity have unfolded right in front of our eyes. Some examples are the horrible situations that occurred in Sudan, Syria, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and most recently, in Israel and Palestine.

    Many large corporations do not reward farmers for the worth of their labor and produce when conducting business with them, leading to price fluctuations, shortages, and inadequate access to food. While better-resourced farmers manage to get food supply contracts,  small-scale farmers often work as laborers on contracted farms. Such practices contribute further to food insecurity by leading farmers, especially small-scale farmers, to become financially unstable.

    The global birth rates are higher than the death rates and our population keeps growing. A population with such fast-paced growth requires support from great quantities of food supplies. However, there is limited growth in food available, which leads to continuous increases in food insecurity around the world. But aside from population growth meaning solely more people and less food, a growing population hinders food distribution and leads to more urbanization and development that often converts agricultural land into urban areas, reducing available cropland and crop production, and therefore amounts of food supplies.

   Biofuels encompass fuels derived from biological material such as crops, algae, or organic waste. Biofuels serve as alternatives to fossil fuels in transporation and heating, and emerged in an effort to tackle climate change. As the demand for biofuels increases,farms are being diverted into using land, water, and other resources previously used for food to grow biofuels instead. Not only do the numbers of grains available for food decrease, but meeting biofuel targets causes the prices of these necessary grains to increase. As a result, millions more starve or shift to cheaper, low quality foods, leading levels of food insecurity to signficantly rise. The growing demand for biofuels also leads to increases in deforestation in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Deforestation results in cleared lands and climate change, causing flooding and adverse weather that further threaten food security by destroying crops.

    <p>

      Drought, floods, typhoons, cyclones, and other natural disasters can wipe out an entire harvest or destroy crops, as well as kill off livestock. Natural disasters also interfere with transportation, storage, and distribution networks, disrupting the flow of food from production areas to consumers and exacerbating scarcity. This devastates countless individuals, especially rural communities and families who rely on such harvests and small-scale staple farming for daily food. The prodiguous damages caused by natural disasters wreak havoc on the lives of many by causing major upheavals in crop production and food distrubution, which in turn drastically increases the levels of food insecurity among those impacted.

        Changes in climatic patterns have fundamentally affected agriculture. Farmers are experiencing the effects of climate change, with earlier rains, longer-lasting droughts, and scarcity of fresh waster due to rising sea levels, storm surges, cyclones, droughts, heatwaves, floods, and other extreme weather events fueled by climate change. These extreme weather events have become frequent and intensive, disrupting crop growth and reducing yields. Over time, climate change leads to shifts in temperature, precipitation and soil quality that worsen agriculture. The rising temperatures and weather-related disruptions also lead to food price inflation. The disruption of crop growth, reduced yields, altered regional growing conditions and the inflation of food prices all caused by climate change greatly increase food insecurity and effectively worsen the lives of many.

      <strong>10. Wastage of Food

    <p>
      According to reports from FAO, about 1.3 billion tonnes of edible food is wasted across the globe every year, mostly in developed countries. Because production levels are greater than consumption, about 1/3 of all food produced for human consumption is thrown away while people continue to die of hunger in developing nations. Food waste also increases costs associated with trasportation and disposal that are then passed on to consumers, causing food to be more expensive and less accessible to vulnerable populations. And because wasted food often ends up in landfills and emits greenhouse gasses, the emissions contribute to climate chnage and indirectly increase food insecurity that way. Food security levels suffer severely at the hands of food wastage, which, if eliminated, could help world hunger immensely and salvage the lives of millions.

      Giant multinational agribusinesses and exporters have flocked the food market over time, leaving small-scale farmers limited avenues to market their produce and make some money. This has led small-scale farmers to sell at unfair prices while giant businesses continue to control the market and sell food at high prices, by targeting customers who are mostly over-selective, leading to food wastage and therefore food insecurity. These corporations also influence policymakers, research, and media coverage, shaping what food is produced, how it’s grown, and who gets to eat it. It puts small-scale farmers and poorer individuals at a loss, keeping them vulnerable to experiencing very high levels of food insecurity.

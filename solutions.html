    <strong>1. Break the Cycle of Conflict and Hunger

    </strong>

  </p>

  <p>
    60% of the world’s hungriest people live in conflict affected zones because of the vicious cycle conflict and hunger create. When war erupts, instability forces people to find illicit and sometimes violent means of acquiring their necessities. By breaking this cycle, we can make sure levels of food insecurity are low even during times of conflict. We can break the cycle by:
    
    <u>1. Improving early warning to systematically identify starvation as a method of warfare and enable early response. </u>To make sure help is reaching those affected by food security crises more effectively, there is a critical need for an independent, data-driven, early warning mechanism that can enable early action and prevent further worsening of the situation.
    
    <u> 2. Prioritizing investment on food security, livelihoods, and resilience-building.</u> Increased investment in food security, agriculture, livelihoods, and resilience-building builds and sustains peace, prevents hunger from being a driver of conflict, and helps prevent the relapse, outbreak, or spread of conflict. 

    
    <u> 3.  Minimizing the impacts of military/security responses to conflict on livelihoods and access to food.</u> Doing this prevents military and peace-keeping operations from threatening livelihoods, worsening food insecurity, and fueling political instability and violence in situations where political objectives — such as anti-migration or counter-terrorism policies — are mixed with humanitarian and development objectives.
    
    <u>4. Upholding respect to International Humanitarian Law by creating a Special Advisor to the UN Secretary-General and considering prosecution against International Humanitarian Law violations.</u> The use of hunger as a weapon of war is a war crime according to Geneva Conventions. Yet in some conflict settings, parties  use siege tactics, weaponize starvation of civilians, or wilfully impede life-saving humanitarian supplies to reach those desperately in need to try and coming out on the winning side, disregarding lives in the process. To combat this, The UN and member states should hold parties to conflict to account for upholding their legal obligations by imposing targeted sanctions in response to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law — including through the prosecution of these crimes in the national and international legal systems.

    <strong> 2. Increase Sustainability and Build Resilience to Climate Change </strong>
  </p>

      <p>
        
        Climate extremes are one of the main drivers of severe hunger. Consecutive and extreme weather events like droughts, flooding, hurricanes and cyclones continue to decimate farming and drive displacement. As a result, communities constantly operate in recovery mode. The resulting diminished economies, destroyed infrastructure, and disrupted access to food significantly reduces people’s capacity to rebuild their livelihoods and prepare for the next imminent disaster. The U.N. World Food Programme is helping communities build resilience to climate change through long-term solutions including:
-Reforestation and land rehabilitation projects;
-Climate insurance for small-scale farmers;
-Providing local institutions with access to sustainable energy solutions; To tackle the challenges of climate change, food availability and food access, farmers must also recieve the help and support they need to grow a more diverse range of crops and livestock. To help support farmers, the U.N. World Food Programme needs to continue to teach farmers new techniques, equip them with tools, and educate their communities about the nutritional importance of eating a wide range of foods.

<strong>3. Help Rural Farmers Connect to Markets</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Small-scale farmers make up the majority of people living in poverty. Their economic losses come from a lack of access to production inputs like proper storage, fertilizer, and farming equipment as well as constant challenges from climate extremes. Helping rural farmers connect to markets ensures they can supply their own communities with lifesaving food, and encourages investments that diversify farmers' crops and expand their business prospects.

        <p class="reduce-food"> 
          <strong> 4. Reduce Food Waste/Loss
          </strong> </p> 

      <p>
         If storage facilities are improved, and there are adequate preparations on how food will be used, less food will be wasted, and communities will become more food-secure. Specific actions that will help reduce food waste include providing farmers with modern storage equipment like silos and air-tight bags, investing in innovations like hydroponics that allow communities to grow, selling and storing food in the harshest conditions, and advocating for the policy that distributes American-grown crops to people in need.

        <strong> 5.  Eliminate Malnutrition in Mothers & Children
        </strong> </p>

      <p>
       Malnutrition can be eliminated in mothers and children if they are supplied with specialized nutritious foods. Several organizations help do this, including Save The Children, Hellen Keller International, Unicef, and Wolrd Food Programme. Donating however much to any of these ogranizations helps increase food security by ensuring food is delivered to more starving individuals.

    <p class="reduce-the-risk"> <strong>
6. Reduce the Risk of Commercializing </strong>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      If food is grown for the purpose of feeding the community or nation, food insecurity levels will go down. Farmers can produce more food crops and later on cash crops, when there are enough food crops in the market. There will be less risk of commercialization of food if it is sufficient in the market. Additionally, programs should be implemented by governments to let farmers know when there is sufficient food for everyone.
        
    </p>

<p class="improve-existing">
  <strong>7. Improve Existing Infrastructural Programs </strong>
  
</p>
<p>
  Many farmers fail to get their produce to the market because of poor infrastructure, roads, storage facilities, and food processing equipment. The food rotates in the farms rather than being taken to those who need it or for processing. If existing infrastructure is improved, more food will be available in the market, leading food insecurity levels to decrease. Not all solutions are about creating new programs. Fixing existing programs should be first priority to help decrease levels of food insecurity.
  
</p>

      <p class="improve-trade">
<strong>8. Improve Trade Policies</strong>
 </p>

  <p>
    Many farmers are unable to feed the community because of unfair trade policies in the market. Because of corporate giants constantly stepping in to commercialize food, It has become harder for small-scale farmers to have their products in the market. Therefore, governments should improve such policies and ensure farmers recieve more opportunities to share their products with larger amounts of people in markets, so they can earn more income for food to increase their levels of food security along with the levels of food security of the communities they provide with food. 
  </p>

  <p class="promote-diversification">
    <strong> 9.  Promote Diversification
    </strong>  </p>


<p>
  Focusing on a single food crop or staple can lead to terrible outcomes in cabbing food insecurity. To improve food security, there needs to be training on the importance of diversified and healthy diets for better nutrition, because having varieties of food and a community educated on the importance of a diversified diet will ensure sufficient staple foods available in the markets.

   <p class="close-the">
     <strong> 10. Close the Yield Gap
     </strong> </p>

      <p>
Most farming lands are drained of their natural fertility levels and cannot produce as much as they did years ago. To fix the problem, soil management and land improvement need to remain a priority. Additionally, the use of land conversion as a tactic to close the yield gap should be avoided, because it encroaches into natural habitats and forests, affects biodiversity and wildlife, and increases GHG emissions. The strategy or program setup should ensure food is available for all and that wildlife and forests are unaffected.
